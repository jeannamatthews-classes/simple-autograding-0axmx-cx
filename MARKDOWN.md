# Experimenting with Different Styles
## The difference between a text file and a markdown file
The difference between a *text file* and a *markdown file* are found in how the text is **formatted**.
### In a text file
In a text file, there are no formatting options for the text like: 
**bold**, 
*italics*, or 
#### headings.
### In a markdown file
In a markdown file, the test is still plain text, but it allows for basic formatting.
For example, some formatting in addition to the above are:
> Blockquotes
>> nested blockquotes
- Unordered Lists
1. Ordered Lists
```
And even code blocks, with support for different languages and syntax highlighting!
```
There are also many more types of formatting you can do.
## However, it should be noted:
Some markdown formatting is slightly different between Github Markdown and Regular Markdown.

The name of my repository is **cautious-octo-tribble**. It was suggested by Github itself.
I'm not sure how Github Actions work. I'm also not sure what Codespaces or Webhooks are.
I might be interested in using Github pages to host a personal website, but probably not.
I'm not very sure at the moment how ssh keys work, so deploying keys on Github would be a bit confusing for me.
I'm also not sure how GitHub Apps work.
